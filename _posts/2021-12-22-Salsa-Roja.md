Salsa Roja is delicious, goes well with pretty much anything and is super easy to make. Here is my recipe to help you out :).

## What you need

* Pot - size depends on the tomatoes and peppers you are using
* Blender or Food Processor
* Water - enough to cover the tomatoes and peppers in the pot
* 3 Roma tomatoes
* 1 Jalapeño or 3 Serrano
* Small bunch cilantro - about 20 stems
* Salt - preferably sea salt
* Lime - can substitute with lemon

### Tip

* Cilantro is also known as Coriander in some countries.
* Your salsa will taste better, nah.. amazing if you grow your own tomatoes or purchase them from a local producer or at a farmers market.

## How to make

* Wash/Rinse your tomatoes, peppers and cilantro
* Boil the tomatoes and peppers.
    * They are ready to be removed when the skin of the tomatoes crack. You can turn off the fire and leave them in a bit longer while you cut your onions.
* Peel and cut your onions into quarters and place them in the blender/food processor.
* Place the tomatoes and cilantro in your blender/food processor.
* Cut the stems off the peppers, also add them to the blender/food processor
* After blending, add lime juice and salt to taste.
    * his step depends on how chunky or runny you want your salsa. I tend to pulse my blender to get it on the chunky side.

Enjoy your fresh home made salsa.

## Notes

* Your pot should be large enough to hold the peppers and tomatoes; but not so large that it takes too long to boil them.
    * If you like spicy, you can substitute Jalapeño for another spicier pepper.
        * I enjoy a good burn so I use Ghost peppers; but a good place to be for most, is between Serrano and Habanero.
* If you don’t like spicy foods, you can substitute spicy peppers with green/red bell pepper.
* Salsas go good with tacos (carne asada is my favorite), scrambled eggs, chicken of beef soup or just plain scoop it on tortilla chips.
