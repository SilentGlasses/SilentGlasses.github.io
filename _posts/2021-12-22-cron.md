Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like computer operating systems. People who set up and maintain software environments use cron to schedule jobs (commands or shell scripts) to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals.

Cron is driven by a crontab (cron table) file, a configuration file that specifies shell commands to run periodically on a given schedule. The crontab files are stored where the lists of jobs and other instructions to the cron daemon are kept. Users can have their own individual crontab files and often there is a system-wide crontab file (usually in `/etc` or a subdirectory of `/etc`) that only system administrators can edit.

## crontab

A crontab file contains instructions to the cron(8) daemon of the general form: _"run this command at this time on this date"_. Each user has their own crontab, and commands in any given crontab will be executed as the user who owns the crontab.

## Crontab Layout

Each line of a crontab file represents a job, and looks like this:

```
+-------------- minute (0-59)
| +------------ hour (0-23)
| | +---------- day of the month (1-31)
| | | +-------- month (1-12)
| | | | +------ day of the week (0-6) (Sunday to Saturday)
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
* * * * * command to execute
```

## Expressions

| Field	        | Required	| Allowed values  | Allowed special characters |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------|----------------------------|
| Minutes	      | Yes	      | 0–59	          | `*` , `, ` , `- `          |
| Hours	        | Yes	      | 0–23	          | `*` , `, ` , `- `          |
| Day of month	| Yes	      | 0-31	          | `*` , `, ` , `- `          |
| Month	        | Yes	      | 0-12 or JAN–DEC	| `*` , `, ` , `- `          |
| Day of week	  | Yes	      | 0–6 or SUN–SAT	| `*` , `, ` , `- `          |
| Year	        | No	      | 1970–2099	      | `*` , `, ` , `- `          |

### Asterisk (`*`)

* asterisk specifies all possible values for a field.

### Comma (`,`)

* Commas define lists.
    * Example: ``"MON,WED,FRI"`` in the 5<sup>th</sup> field (day of week) means Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

### Hyphen (`-`)

* Hyphens define ranges.
    * Example: `2019–2022` indicates every year between 2019 and 2022, inclusive.

### Pound (`#`)

* Pounds define comments.
    * Example: `# This command will initiate a script that does something.`

### Step Values

* Step values can be used in conjunction with ranges. Following a range with `/<number>` specifies skips of the number's value through the range.
    * Example: `0-23/2` indicates every other hour, so `0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22`

## Example Cron File

``` bash
# run five minutes after midnight, every day
5 0 * * *       $HOME/bin/daily.job >> $HOME/tmp/out 2>&1
# run at 2:15pm on the first of every month -- output mailed to user
15 14 1 * *     $HOME/bin/monthly
# run at 10 pm on weekdays, annoy Joe
0 22 * * 1-5    mail -s "It's 10pm" joe%Joe,%%Where are your kids?%
23 0-23/2 * * * echo "run 23 minutes after midn, 2am, 4am ..., everyday"
5 4 * * sun     echo "run at 5 after 4 every sunday"
# run this as root
* * * * * root touch /tmp/file
```

## General Overview

### List the jobs for the current user

```
crontab -l
```

### Edit your crontab

```
crontab -e
```

If this is the first time you are running cron, you will get a prompt to choose your default editor, this list will vary depending on which editors your have installed

```
no crontab for user - using an empty one
Select an editor. To change later, run 'select-editor'.
 1. /bin/nano <---- easiest
 2. /usr/bin/vim.basic
 3. /usr/bin/vim.tiny
 4. /bin/ed
Choose 1-4 [1]:
```

### Edit someone else's cron jobs

``` bash
crontab -u username -e
```

### Remove all cron jobs for the current user

```
crontab -r
```

## Example crontab use

These are just some examples to get you started.

!!! Important "Keep in mind"
    There is a difference between running a command every x [window] vs running things every x<sup>th</sup> [window].

    * Example: Every 15 minutes vs every 15<sup>th</sup> minute.
