## What you need

- Skillet or BBQ grill _for roasting ingredients_
- Blender or Food Processor
- 1 lbs Roma Tomatoes
- 1 White Onion
- 1 Jalape√±o or 3 Serrano peppers _can be left out if you don't want spice_
- Cilantro _1/2 cup should be enough but add more if you feel like you need more_
- Salt _preferably sea salt_
- Lime

!!! tip
    * Cilantro is also known as coriander in some countries.
    * Your salsa will taste better, nah ... **AMAZING** ... if you grow your own tomatoes or purchase them from a local producer or at a local farmers market.

## How to make

- Wash your tomatoes, peppers and cilantro.
- Peel and cut onions into half. _make sure to remove any tough outer rings_
- Roast the onions, peppers and tomatoes. _keep rotating them frequently so they don't burn_
    - Onions are ready when they get a good caramelization
    - Peppers are ready when the skin starts to gt a good char
    - Tomatoes are ready when their skin starts to crack
- Place all ingredients in the blender/food processor and blend.
    - This step depends on how chunky or smooth you want your salsa. I tend to puls mine so I can control it and like my salsa on the chunky side.
- After blending, add lime and salt to taste.

Enjoy your Salsa!

!!! note
    - If you realy like a good spice, you can use Hanero or Ghost peppers.
    - If you don't like spicy food, you can use bell peppers.
    - Salsas go good with tacos, scrambled eggs, chicken or beef soup, or just plain to at with chips and an ice cold beer.
